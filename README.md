# AntiAfk
Tired of being kicked for being AFK? This tool helps you stay active in most games by simulating natural player behavior, keeping your session alive without needing constant attention. Whether you're stepping away for a few minutes or just don’t feel like moving, AntiAFK has your back. It works silently in the background, making it harder for games to detect inactivity and auto-kick you.

Perfect for grinding, waiting rooms, or just avoiding annoying timeouts.
⚠️ Use at your own risk – not all games allow tools like this, and we’re not responsible if something happens.
